###### Modified Architecture
![Bottleneck](https://github.com/chibuta/malaria-parasite-quantification/blob/master/bottleneck.jpg)
Bottleneck block: 3 x 3 depthwise convolution with a stride of 2 for downsample. A depth multiplier of 2 doubles the number of output channels for only the downsample convolution operation.
